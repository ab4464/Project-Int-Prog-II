# Project-Int-Prog-II
App for promoting networking between TC students

### What is your application?
The application has the goal to boost collaborative learning and networking among students at TC Columbia University. It would allow students to: 
- Connect with other students based on professional interests and experience.
- Participate from a learning space open to the creation of multidisciplinary collaborative projects. 
- Navigate the University System by receiving (and providing) first hand advice from more experienced peers.
NOTE: There’s an MyTC App that has general info about News related with the school, campaigns for raising money, important numbers and directory, maps, and info about the shuttle. When you login, you have more specifics about your classes, grades, etc. But this App doesn’t offer any space for networking and connecting with other students. Maybe my project could be thought as a new feature for MyTC App.

### What it is not?
It’s not a place for just socializing or finding an intimate partner. You can use Facebook and/or Tinder for that. This App is intended for meaningful communication. It is intended for networking, collaborative learning and connecting with classmates.  

### 3 core features
- Student Profile: Students can create a profile. Some of the information requested will be:
Name, program of study and department, main professional interests, skills, intended graduation date, classes taken and professors in charge (if we can link this to the students TC account maybe we can have the app automatically import that data), if they are part of any lab and if they are involved in any project. This will allow students to make a search based on these features. Maybe they can pair their account with their linkedin profile.
   Based on individual profiles, people sharing projects, under the same program of study or members of the same lab can create a group profile as well. The App itself can suggest to meet people or advertise certain lab according  to professional interests. 
- Geo-location: All the students signed in could have the opportunity to turn their location on. Each person will represent a point in the map (maybe with their profile pictures on it). These points/icons will be clickable and will allow us access to the students’ profile. From there we can learn more about our classmates, random people found in hallways, or at an event. You can start a conversation online with them.
- ChatRoom: There will be space for private chat and group chat. This is going to be the core feature. Students would have the opportunity to interact with each other, learn more about their programs of study, professors, professional experience, events, etc. It will also lead to future collaborations. 
- Events: The App can load events from the TC Columbia server, but users can provide themselves that information as well          . Since it is intended for networking, users could advertise events inside and outside TC. 
    
### Intended users
TC Columbia community, particularly the students at TC. Potentially, it could be expanded to the whole Columbia University or even to other Universities.
